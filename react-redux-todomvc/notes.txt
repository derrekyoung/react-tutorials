In order to help up test our components, the React library provides the TestUtils addons that provide, among others, the following methods:
- renderIntoDocument, that renders a component into a detached DOM node;
- scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithTag, that finds all instances of components in the DOM with the provided tag (like li, input…);
- scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass, that finds all instances of components in the DOM with the provided class;
- Simulate, that simulates user actions (a click, a key press, text inputs…)

The TestUtils addon is not included in the react package, so we have to install it separately
npm install --save-dev react-addons-test-utils

Redux
-The Reducer is the one that actually contains the logic of the action
-The Action is the constants list of what actions are available
--> Action Creators let the app know which of these constants are available`
